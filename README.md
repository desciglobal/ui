  <h1>How to add an event?</h1>
</div>

You can make a event submission on the website and email johannes[at]molecule.to if you have questions, or make a pull request on github if you want to improve the page. Desci.Global is a next.js (react) app with tailwind as CSS lib. To get the page working on your local machiene, you will need the airtable api key, email me at johannes@molecule.to and we will set you up in no time.
